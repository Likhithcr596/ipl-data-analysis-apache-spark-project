# ipl-data-analysis-apache-spark-project

This project demonstrates data processing and analysis of IPL data using PySpark on the Databricks Community Edition. The data, sourced from Amazon S3, is loaded as CSV files into Apache Spark. Several transformations are performed using PySpark, including leveraging window functions for advanced analytics. The cleaned and transformed data is then visualized with Matplotlib to generate meaningful insights. The project showcases the power of Apache Spark for big data processing and Python for data visualization.
